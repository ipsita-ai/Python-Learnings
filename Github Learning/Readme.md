Git : Version Control System
Version Control System records the history of our project at different stages.
It allows us to track history of the project and allow to work collaboratively.
There are two types of version control system :
  1) Centralised : All team members connect to central server .
    Drawback : Single point of failure
    Examples : Subversion and TFS
  2) Distributed : A distributed version control system (DVCS) brings a local copy of the complete repository to every team member's computer, so they can commit, branch, and merge locally. The server doesn't have to store a physical file for each branch â€” it just needs the differences between each commit.
